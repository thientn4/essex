# Demo video:
- This video demos core requirements for the application as requested:
        - Displays all core property information (from PROPERTY_LIST.csv) + additional property metadata (occupancy rate, number of parking lots, EV charger availability, redevelopment opportunities).
        - Allows the Asset Management team to input their additional property metadata.
        - Allows users to select a property and fetches and displays 2023 US Census occupancy data
        - Add a chart that shows years built by decade. Hook up some chart interactivity â€“ for example, clicking on your chart filters the properties in view.
        - At least one idea of your own that you think would be helpful for users:
              - Search feature to search for properties based on their address and year built
              - Google map to display the latitude and longitude of a property in a more interactive way
              - The application is mobile responsive to make it flexible for user to use the app anywhere in any devices (laptop, tablet, mobile phone)
